A **device preview switcher** is a simple feature that allows users to view how content appears across different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This is especially important for responsive web design, where websites need to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.

For example, designers and developers often create websites that look great on large desktop screens, but itâ€™s equally important for these websites to look good on smaller mobile devices. Instead of physically checking the website on every device, a preview switcher makes it easy to see how a design responds to different screen sizes. By clicking a button corresponding to a device (like "Mac" or "iPhone"), users can switch between previews instantly.
